       <h2>Today, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/05/12/why-we-need-more-resources-prescription-opioid-and-heroin-epidemic">drug overdoses take more lives annually than traffic accidents</a>.</h2>
<p>But there is something we can do – we can make things better by becoming more aware of how to identify persons struggling with drug addiction and making it more commonplace to talk about addiction. One of the reasons that so many go untreated is because they fly under the radar, appearing to be fully functional in their day-to-day lives.</p>
<h3><strong>So What Exactly is a Functioning Addict?</strong></h3>
<p>Simply put, a highly functioning addict is a person who is able to hide their addiction under the trappings of seemingly functional daily life, such as a nice job, stable living situation, and working relationships. The reality is that many addicts don’t fit the stereotype of the typical substance abuser.</p>
<h3><strong>How to Identify a Functioning Addict</strong></h3>
<p>First, drop the stigmas of what you think an addict should look and act like. The reality is they look and act quite similar to you. The unfortunate difference is they may have a few red flags that go completely unnoticed.<br />
Addicts will typically want to use when they’re stressed, overwhelmed, or even when they are feeling lonely. Many functioning addicts are highly respected in their community. They have great jobs, friends, and seemingly well-adjusted lives despite their habits.</p>
<p>Superficially, they may look like everything is copasetic. But the reality is they’re on a dangerously disguised downward spiral. On the outside they have a balance that many would envy; on the inside they’re falling apart.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of going undetected for so long, their downfall can be often dramatic and unfortunately tragic.</p>
<h3><strong>The Dangers of Being a Functioning Addict</strong></h3>
<p>The dangers are many. For starters, they tend to believe they have fewer reasons to stop using. They believe they are holding it together. This can result in more prolonged substance abuse and greater damage to the mind and body.</p>
<p>Outsiders will tend to put less pressure on them to change due to their apparent outward success. Because they have less financial constraints, they don’t have to hold back. They also have dramatically less moderation when it comes to engaging in detrimental behavior.</p>
<h3><strong>Symptoms</strong></h3>
<p>If you’re wondering if someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, <a href="http://alcoholrehab.com/drug-addiction/recognize-a-functioning-addict/">here are a few questions you can ask yourself to help identify a problem</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do they smell of alcohol even when they are not openly drinking?</li>
<li>Are they unable to cope with stress, external, and internal issues without the use of drugs and alcohol?</li>
<li>Do they tend to have a dramatic change in personality when sober and when drinking?</li>
<li>When confronted on their habits, do they tend to get defensive?</li>
<li>Are they secretive about their drinking patterns?</li>
<li>Do they seem to live a double life?</li>
<li>Have they lost interest in hobbies that once filled their schedule?</li>
<li>Do their closest friends all engage in substance abuse?</li>
<li>Do they tend to drink more than intended? For example, they’ll go out for one drink and end up drinking the entire night.</li>
<li>Do they avoid social gatherings and events unless drinking is involved?</li>
<li>Do they blackout?</li>
<li>They engage in risky sex, especially when using.</li>
<li>They regularly drink more than the recommended levels – this would be one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men under 65 years of age (1 drink for men over 65).</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How to Help Someone Struggling with Addiction</strong></h3>
<p>There are many <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/treatment/what-to-do-if-your-adult-friend-or-loved-one-has-problem-drugs">proven methods available when confronting someone about their habits</a>. But be aware, you never want them to feel like they’re being ambushed. This is not the place to be overbearing or over emotional. Be tactful in your approach.</p>
<p>First things first: It is extremely important that friends and family stop making excuses for the individual suffering from substance abuse and their behavior. Being successful in some aspects of their lives is never an excuse to behave poorly when abusing drugs, nor is it an excuse to allow them to continue on this way.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering exactly how to approach this situation, here is a suggestion: You can confront them in a calm, safe, informative manner. Explain how their behavior makes you feel in an open and comforting tone.</p>
<p>Leave subtle hints around their or your home such as informative literature on recovery. This works best when you take into consideration their needs, interests, and age. So don’t just throw the first generic sobriety pamphlet their way. Each person is unique and so is their road to recovery.</p>
<p>Oftentimes it can be a great relief to realize that seeking help will not alienate them from society, ruin their career and social life.</p>
<p>Many struggling with addiction are reluctant to seek help for fear of how it will affect their future, especially when the word of their addiction gets out. Inform them that they can in fact enter rehab anonymously. Legally, a person cannot be denied a job or fired because they are in treatment for a substance abuse disorder. Though, employers can have different policies regarding healthcare and sick leave so it’s best to be familiar with the conditions of the company. But keep in mind: People who seek treatment for substance abuse problems are much more likely to keep their jobs than those who do not.</p>
<p>There are options. You can take a sabbatical or tell people you’re heading on a vacation. Do whatever they need to make sure they’re away from their addictions and in a safe supportive environment. Substance abuse treatment programs can offer a variety of approaches suitable to the individual and their specific needs.</p>
